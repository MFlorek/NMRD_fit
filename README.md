# NMRD_fit
Matlab based NMRD profiles fitting software. 
Allows loading R1(f) stored in: 1) ascii file 2) Originlab workbook 3) Stelar Export File (.sef).
1H relaxation dispersion can be fitted with model including contributions steming from a) rotational diffusion (BPP model with lorentzian spectral densities) b) translational diffusion (Hard Sphere Force Free model) c) rotation mediated translational diffusion (RMTD model).
As the software was initially developed to analyze relaxation data of ionic liquids, relaxation terms related with translational diffusion include 1H-1H and 1H-19F interactions.
